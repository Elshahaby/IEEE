## Q2: What are the key differences between Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

| Feature             |     CSR     |  SSR  |
| :------------------:| :----------:| :---: |
| Rendering Location  | Browser(client) | Server |
| Intial Page Load Speed | Slower-must download Js first that gives order to fill HTML file later | Faster-HTML is pre-rendered at server |
| SEO | Not ideal | Very good as content is allready in HTML |
| Interactivity After Load | Very Fast (all js file already loaded) | Less faster-as it requires hydration |
| User Experience | Blank screen or loading spinner at first | Content visible immediately |
| Network Load | Less server load after initial load | Higher server load(renders every request at server) |
| Use Cases | Web apps with complex UIs that require a lot of interactivity | SEO-heavy pages (blogs, Documentations)

- *CSR* is great for fast, interactive apps after load but has slower first paint.
- *SSR* improves initial load and SEO, but may require more server resources.

Here is a question come to mind:

####  What Does `Hydration` mean?
in SSR, Your server sends a fully rendered HTML page to the browser. But here's the catch:
That HTML page looks good, but it doesn't do anything yet. no buttons work, no modals open, no interactivity.
- `Hyderation`: is the process where the browser downloads the JavaScript bundle and **connects** it to the static HTML to make it interactive.

To simplyify the Idea of Hydration Think of it like this:
- **Server sends**: "Here's a beautiful page of HTML."
- **Browser Says**: "Cool, let me attach all the event listeners and dynamic behavior now."

*Example*
```tsx
// Server renders this:
<h1>Hello</h1> <button>Click me</button>

// Browser loads JS later and says:
button.addEventListener("click", () => alert("Clicked!"));

```
