5. **Node.js Threading Model** *(2 points)*
   - Select the most accurate description of Node.js threading and event loop:
     - [ ] Node.js uses multiple threads to handle incoming requests and execute JavaScript code simultaneously.
     - [ ] Node.js follows a single-threaded model that utilizes an event loop for handling I/O operations asynchronously.
     - [ ] Node.js implements a multi-threaded architecture where each request is processed by a dedicated thread.
     - [ ] Node.js event loop handles only synchronous operations, while asynchronous operations are executed in separate threads.

### The correct answer is: Node.js follows a single-threaded model that utilizes an event loop for handling I/O operations asynchronously.


Explanation:

- Single-Threaded Model:
    - Node.js operates primarily on a single thread for executing JavaScript code.
    - The main thread executes all the JavaScript code in the event loop, which coordinates asynchronous operations efficiently.

- Event Loop:

    - The event loop is at the heart of Node.js. It allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations without creating new threads for each task.
    - When a blocking or asynchronous operation (e.g., file I/O, network request) is encountered, the event loop delegates it to the appropriate system kernel or worker thread and continues running other tasks.

- Asynchronous I/O:

    - Node.js benefits from the non-blocking nature of asynchronous I/O operations to handle multiple requests concurrently, even though it is single-threaded.
    - For example, while waiting for a database query or file read operation to complete, the event loop processes other tasks.

- Thread Pool for Heavy Tasks:

    - Internally, Node.js uses a limited thread pool (via the libuv library) for CPU-intensive operations, such as file system operations, compression, or cryptography.
    - These tasks are executed on background threads managed by the libuv thread pool, not directly in the event loop.

1. "Node.js uses multiple threads to handle incoming requests and execute JavaScript code simultaneously." <br>
- Incorrect. JavaScript execution in Node.js is single-threaded. Only I/O operations or heavy tasks are offloaded to worker threads when needed.

2. "Node.js implements a multi-threaded architecture where each request is processed by a dedicated thread."<br>
- Incorrect. Node.js does not create a new thread for every request. It uses the event loop to handle requests on a single thread.

3. "Node.js event loop handles only synchronous operations, while asynchronous operations are executed in separate threads."<br>
- Incorrect. The event loop handles asynchronous operations by delegating them to the system or a thread pool, and resumes processing their callbacks when they are complete. It does not rely on separate threads for all asynchronous tasks.
