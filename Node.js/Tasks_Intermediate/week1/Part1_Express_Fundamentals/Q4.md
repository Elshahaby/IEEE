4. **Multipart Parsing** 
   - Explore the `bodyParser.multipart()` method
   - Understand its functionality and use cases

First of all we talk about Multipart Parsing when our Form has an attribute enctype = "multipart/form-data" <br>
Which affect request header (Content-Type: "multipart/form-data")<br>

Then, as reading npm body-parser Docs 'bodyParesr.multipart()' method is not a built-in method in body-parser.<br>
Instead, handling binary encoded data as multipart/form-data (images, PDFs) requires using third-party middleware like 'multer'. 

### How It Works:- 

1. Browser Submission: HTML form sends text fields and file data in parts, separated by boundaries.
2. middleware parsing at sever-side: 
- create a middleware uses multer which reads the body as binary data and parses it into:
    - Text fields: Added to `req.body`.
    - Files: Stored in a specified location and details available in `req.file` or `req.files`.

<br>

- it provides a built in error handling like type chechking and limit size

### Use Cases for Multipart Parsing
1. File Uploads:
- Allow users to upload files such as images, PDFs, videos.
- Use case: Profile picture uploads, document submission systems.

2. Forms with Mixed Data:
- Forms that combine file uploads and text fields (filling out a registration form with an attached profile picture).

3. Handling Large Binary Data: 
- Multipart parsing is efficient for transferring large binary files compared to encoding them as base64 in JSON.
