### 1. **Route Response Prediction** 
   - Predict the response body when accessing `http://localhost:3000/hello`
   
---

### Answer is 
```
HiWelcome
```

**Explanation:-**

***First Middleware (app.use):***

This middleware executes for all routes.
It writes "Hi" to the response using res.write() and calls next().
As a result, "Hi" is written to the response body.

***Second Middleware (app.use('/', ...)):***

This middleware executes for all routes starting with / (which includes /hello).
It writes "Welcome" to the response using res.write() and ends the response with res.end().
Since res.end() is called here, the response ends, and no further middleware is executed.

***Third Middleware (app.use('/hello', ...)):***

This middleware will not be executed because the response has already ended in the previous middleware.
