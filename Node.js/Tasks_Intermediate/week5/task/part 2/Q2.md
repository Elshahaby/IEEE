## Compare and contrast session-based authentication with token-based authentication. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach in web application design.

**1. Session-Based Authentication** <br>
- How It Works :-
    - The server authenticates the user and creates a session.
    - session ID is stored on the server and sent to the client as a cookie.
    - The client includes this session ID in subsequent requests.
    - The server verifies the session ID to authenticate the user.

- Pros
    - Simpler Implementation: Uses built-in session management in frameworks like Express, Django, and Rails.
    - More Secure Against Token Theft: Since tokens aren’t stored on the client (except session cookies), it reduces exposure to client-side vulnerabilities.
    - Easier to Manage Logout: Sessions can be invalidated immediately by the server.

- Cons
    - Not Scalable: Each session requires server storage, which becomes inefficient as the number of users grows.
    - Less Suitable for APIs & Microservices: Requires server state, making it difficult to share authentication across multiple services.
    - CSRF Risks: Since cookies are automatically sent with requests, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**2. Token-Based Authentication**
- How It Works:-
    - The server authenticates the user and issues a JWT (JSON Web Token) or other token.
    - The client stores the token (e.g., in localStorage, sessionStorage, or as an HTTP-only cookie).
    - The client sends the token in the Authorization header with each request.
    - The server verifies the token’s signature and extracts the user’s identity.

- Pros
    - Stateless & Scalable: No need for server-side session storage, making it ideal for distributed applications.
    - Better for APIs & Microservices: Since the token is self-contained, it can be used across different services.
    - More Flexible Authentication: Works well with mobile apps, SPAs (Single Page Applications), and third-party services.

- Cons
    - Harder to Revoke Tokens: Unlike session-based auth, there is no central place to invalidate tokens (unless using a revocation mechanism like a token blacklist).
    - Security Risks: If stored in localStorage, tokens are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    - Larger Payload: JWTs contain claims (metadata), making them larger than simple session IDs, which can impact performance if misused.
