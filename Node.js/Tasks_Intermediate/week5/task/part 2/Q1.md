## Q1. Explain the concept of password salting and why it's crucial in password protection. Describe how it enhances security against rainbow table attacks.

**What is Password Salting?** <br>
is the process of adding a unique, random string (salt) to a password before hashing it. The primary goal is to make each hashed password unique, even if two users have the same password.

<br>

**üõ°Ô∏è Why is Salting Crucial in Password Protection?** <br>
- `Prevents Hash Collisions:` If two users have the same password ("password123"), salting ensures their hashed versions are different.
- `Defends Against Rainbow Table Attacks:` Precomputed hash dictionaries (rainbow tables) become useless because each hash is unique due to the salt.
- `Enhances Brute Force Resistance:` Attackers must compute hashes individually for each user instead of relying on precomputed hashes.
- `Prevents Lookup Attacks:` If attackers steal hashed passwords, they can‚Äôt match them with known hashes without knowing the salt.

`How Does Salting Prevent Rainbow Table Attacks?`
A rainbow table is a massive database of precomputed hash values for common passwords. If passwords are stored without a salt, attackers can simply look up a hash in their table and instantly find the original password.
With Salting:
Each user gets a unique salt, so even if two people use "password123", their stored hashes are completely different. This makes rainbow tables useless because attackers would need a separate rainbow table for each salt.
