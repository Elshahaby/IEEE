### Q1: Explain the four types of function binding in JavaScript: implicit binding, explicit binding, new binding, and default binding. How do they differ from each other?

#### 1. Implicit Binding
    Implicit binding is one of the most common and intuitive ways to handle the `this` keyword.It relies on the call site, which is the object used to invoke a function.

    You use implicit binding by calling a function with a "." before it. For example `obj.foo()` results in implicit binding.
    When using implicit binding, the value of `this` is the object just before the final "." before the function.
    For example in `obj.foo()`, the value of `this` in foo is obj.
    In `objA.objB.foo`(), the value of `this` in foo is `objB`.
    In `objA.objB.objC.foo()`, the value of `this` in foo is `objC`.

    Basically the value of `this` is the object at the very right of the function call before the actual function.

    Implicit binding enables developers to share behavior across different contexts by referencing a single function

```js
const workshop1 = { topic: "JavaScript" };
const workshop2 = { topic: "React" };

function ask() {
    console.log(`Welcome to the ${this.topic} workshop!`);
}

workshop1.ask = ask;
workshop2.ask = ask;

workshop1.ask(); // Outputs: Welcome to the JavaScript workshop!
workshop2.ask(); // Outputs: Welcome to the React workshop!
```
    In this example, the this keyword within the ask function refers to the workshop object. Implicit binding associates this with the object that triggers the function.

#### 2. Explicit Binding 

#### Using .call and .apply
    Explicit binding provides control over the this context of a function using the .call and .apply methods. These methods take the desired this context as their first argument.
```js
const workshop1 = { topic: "JavaScript" };
const workshop2 = { topic: "React" };

function ask() {
    console.log(`Welcome to the ${this.topic} workshop!`);
}

ask.call(workshop1); // Outputs: Welcome to the JavaScript workshop!
ask.call(workshop2); // Outputs: Welcome to the React workshop!
```

With explicit binding, you explicitly specify the this context, allowing you to share functions across different objects but with precise control.

#### Introducing Hard Binding
To address the issue of losing the this binding, developers often use a technique called "hard binding". This technique ensures that a function's this context remains fixed, no matter how it is called. The .bind method allows you to create a new function with a specific this context: 

```js
function delayedAsk() {
    setTimeout(
        function () {
            console.log(`Welcome to the ${this.topic} workshop!`);
        }.bind(workshop), // Hard binding to the workshop object
        1000
    );
}

const workshop = { topic: "JavaScript" };

delayedAsk();
```

By using .bind(workshop), you force the this context within the setTimeout callback to always reference the workshop object.

This approach provides predictability but sacrifices some of the flexibility inherent in JavaScript.

Hard binding is valuable when you need consistent behaviour across function invocations, but it should be used thoughtfully to balance predictability and flexibility.

#### Striking a Balance

The choice between flexible and predictable this binding is not accidental; it is intentional. Implicit binding offers flexibility, allowing you to share behavior among different contexts. However, there are scenarios where predictability is essential. The key is to strike a balance:

Use implicit or explicit binding when flexibility is required and different contexts are beneficial.
Utilize hard binding when you need predictability, ensuring that the this context remains fixed.
However, overusing hard binding may lead to a less maintainable and rigid codebase. Strive for a balance that aligns with your project's requirements, offering the right mix of flexibility and predictability for your specific use cases.

### 3. The new Keyword
The `new` keyword is commonly misunderstood as a `class` instantiation operator. However, it's not inherently tied to classes. Its true role is to invoke a function with specific behaviours. When you use new with a function, it carries out four distinct tasks:

- `Creating a New Empty Object`: new instantly generates a new empty object. This is the object that the function will operate on.

- `Linking to Another Object`: The new keyword connects the newly created object to another object (to the prototype).

- `Invoking the Function`: The function specified after new is called. However, the function is executed with its this keyword bound to the new object, not the linked one. This is a crucial distinction.

- `Handling Return Values`: After executing the function, if it doesn't return its own object explicitly, the new keyword assumes that the function intends to return this.

```js
function Workshop(topic) {
    this.topic = topic;
}

const jsWorkshop = new Workshop("JavaScript");

console.log(jsWorkshop.topic); // Outputs: JavaScript
```
In this example, the new keyword creates a new object, links it to Workshop, invokes the Workshop function with the this context set to the new object, and implicitly returns the new object.

### 4. Default Binding

When none of the previous three rules apply, the fourth and final rule comes into effect. By default, the this keyword references the global object, except in strict mode. In strict mode, it defaults to undefined. This rule serves as a fallback when other binding rules don't match.
