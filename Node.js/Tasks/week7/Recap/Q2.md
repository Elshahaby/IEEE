### Q2:  What will be the output of this code and why?

```js
let student = { 
   name: "Saleh",
   subjects = ["Math","Science","English"]
}
console.log(typeof typeof student)
```

the output is `string`.

- Why?

    - First `typeof student`: student is an object, so typeof student returns `object`.
    - Second `typeof`: The typeof operator is applied again to the result `object`, which is a string. Since "object" is a string, typeof "object" returns `string`.

Thus, the final output will be "string".
