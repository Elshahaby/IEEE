## Q3: what is the method used to parse the response body comes that from HTML form?

In Express.js, the method used to parse the response body that comes from an HTML form is through the `bodyparser.urlencoded()` middleware. This middleware parses incoming request bodies with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type in request header, which is the default encoding used when submitting HTML form data.

#### Example:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

// Middleware to parse URL-encoded form data
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post("/submit-form", (req, res) => {
  // Access form data through req.body
  const name = req.body.name;
  const email = req.body.email;
  res.send(`Form submitted! Name: ${name}, Email: ${email}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

Options for `express.urlencoded()`:

1. extended: true (recommended):
   Allows for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, using the qs library.
   This means you can pass nested objects and arrays in form data.

2. extended: false:
   Uses the default Node.js querystring library, which does not support complex/nested objects in the form data.
