## Q3: What are the common reasons that can cause an Express application to hang or become unresponsive? Please provide specific scenarios or examples.

### 1. Blocking the Event Loop

Express is built on top of Node.js, which uses a single-threaded event loop to handle asynchronous tasks. Any blocking operation in the event loop can cause the entire application to hang since Node.js wonâ€™t be able to process other requests until the blocking task is finished.

#### Scenarios:
- Synchronous operations: If you use a synchronous function like fs.readFileSync or a CPU-heavy task directly in the request handler, it can block the event loop.

- Example:

```js
app.get('/read-file', (req, res) => {
  const data = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/large/file.txt');  // Blocks the event loop
  res.send(data);
});
```
In this case, while reading the large file synchronously, no other requests will be processed until the file is completely read.

- Heavy CPU-bound tasks: Intensive computation such as looping through a large dataset or performing cryptographic operations inside the event loop can cause the application to hang.

- Example:

```js
app.get('/compute', (req, res) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {}  // Heavy computation that blocks the event loop
  res.send('Computation finished');
});
```
This loop will block the event loop, making the app unresponsive while the computation is running.

### 2. Unresolved Promises
If an asynchronous operation does not complete or a promise is left unresolved, it can cause the application to hang since the response is never sent back.

### Scenario:
- Missing await in async functions: Forgetting to use await in an async function can leave a promise unresolved, causing the request to hang.

- Example:

```js
app.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
  const data = getDataFromDatabase();  // Missing 'await', returns unresolved promise
  res.send(data);  // This may not execute as expected
});
```

### 3. Missing `next()` in Middleware
Middleware functions must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware or route handler. If `next()` is not called and the response is not sent, the request will remain unresolved, and the application will hang.

Scenario:
Custom middleware not calling `next()`: If you forget to call next() in your middleware, Express won't know what to do next, causing the request to hang.

Example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware executed');
  // Forgot to call next() or send a response
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});
```
Here, the request will hang indefinitely because the middleware doesn't call next() or send a response.
