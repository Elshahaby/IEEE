## Q5: In a scenario, the user tries to enter the login page while he is already logged in. You, as the developer, know that he did that by mistake. So you need to send him to the homepage instead. How can you implement that in Express.js?

b. res.navigate('/') <br>
c. res.redirect('/') <br>
d. res.send('/')     <br>

### Correct answer is
c. res.redirect('/')
