## Q1: Define the "Middleware" term and it's usage in Express.js

Middleware functions are crucial in handling requests and responses, performing various operations in between.
In Express.js, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle.

#### Its Usage

- Processing incoming requests: Handling tasks like parsing JSON data, handling form data, or logging requests.
- Security: Adding authentication/authorization checks using libraries like Passport.js.
- Error handling: Managing error responses and exceptions.
- Routing logic: You can use middleware to conditionally run specific code based on certain routes, user authentication, or data validation.

### Types of Middlewares:-

#### 1. Built-In Middleware
Express comes with some built-in middleware functions like express.json(), express.urlencoded(), and express.static().

```js
// Built-in middleware for parsing JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));
```
Note: express.json() allows you to parse incoming JSON payloads, while express.static() serves static files.

#### 2. Creating Custom Middleware
Let’s create a middleware function that logs each incoming request.

```js
// Logging Middleware
function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
  next();
}

// Using custom middleware
app.use(logger);
```
Note: This custom middleware logs the method and URL of every incoming request.

#### 3. Middleware for Route Handling
You can define middleware specifically for certain routes.

```js
// Middleware for a specific route
app.get('/dashboard', authenticate, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the dashboard.');
});

function authenticate(req, res, next) {
  if (req.query.admin === 'true') {
    next(); // User is authenticated
  } else {
    res.send('Authentication required');
  }
}
```
Note: The authenticate middleware is used only for the /dashboard route.

#### 4. Third-Party Middleware
You can also use third-party middleware like morgan for logging or helmet for securing your Express apps.

```js
const morgan = require('morgan');

// Use Morgan for logging
app.use(morgan('dev'));
```
Note: The morgan middleware logs incoming requests, making it easier to debug and monitor your application.

#### 5. Error Handling Middleware
Error handling middleware is defined with four arguments instead of three and sits at the bottom of the middleware stack.

```js
// Error-handling middleware
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send(err);
}

// Using the error-handling middleware
app.use(errorHandler);
```
Note: This error-handling middleware captures errors and sends a 500 status code.
