## Q3: What will be the output of this code?

```JS
const x = User.findOne({username:"elgokar"})
const y = User.find({})
const z = await User.findById(66eb21a982f34874a0323f7a)

console.log(typeof x)
console.log(typeof y)
console.log(typeof z)
```

**1. `User.findOne({username: "elgokar"}):`**

findOne() is an asynchronous Mongoose method that queries for a single document. It returns a promise.
Since await is missing, `x` will `hold the promise` which is an `object`, not the actual document.

typeof x: Since x holds a promise (from User.findOne() without await), the output will be:

```js
object
```
- In JavaScript, typeof Promise is "object".


**2. `User.find({}):`**

find() is an asynchronous Mongoose method that returns a promise that resolves to an array of documents.
`y` will also `hold the promise` witch is `object`, as there is no await to resolve it.


typeof y: Similarly, y is also a promise (from User.find() without await), so the output will be:
```js
object
```

**3. `await User.findById(66eb21a982f34874a0323f7a):`**

findById() is an asynchronous method that fetches a document by its ID.
Since this query is awaited, z will contain the actual result of the document, not a promise.

typeof z: Since z is awaited, it contains the actual document returned by findById(), or null if no document was found. The output will depend on whether the document was found or not:

If the document exists, the output will be:
```js
object
```
If no document is found (i.e., null is returned), the output will be:
```js
object
```
because `typeof null` is also `"object"` in JavaScript.


### final Answer

```js
object
object
object
```
