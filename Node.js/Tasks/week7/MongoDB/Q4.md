## Q4: In the following code 3b3aziz trying to update a user age in the database but it doosn't work as expected, what the problem in his code and how to solve it?

```js
const updateAge = () => {
    const user = User.findOne({username:"sherbiny"},callback)
    console.log(user.age) //output ===> 20
    user.age=25;
    user.save();
    console.log(user.age) //output ===> 20
}
```

The issue is that the call to `User.findOne()` is asynchronous, but the code is treating it as synchronous. 
The problem is that `user.save()` is being called before the promise from `User.findOne()` is resolved, meaning `user` is not populated when attempting to update it.

Explanation:

**1. `findOne()` is asynchronous:** The `User.findOne()` method returns a promise or uses a callback if provided, but in the current code, it is being used as if it returns the user object immediately, which is not the case. The user object will be `undefined` until the query is resolved.

**2. `console.log(user.age)` is executed before user is fetched:** Since user is not yet populated, logging `user.age` right after `findOne()` will not work as expected. The same applies to `user.age = 25;` and `user.save()`. They occur before the asynchronous operation resolves, so nothing gets updated.

so, In the wrong code, both logs will output `undefined` and `undefined` because `user` is not yet populated due to the asynchronous nature of `findOne()` and the lack of `await` or `.then()`.

---

## Solution:
You need to either use callbacks, `then()` (for promises), or `async/await` to handle the asynchronous nature of `findOne()`.

Corrected code using `async/await`:
```js
const updateAge = async () => {
    try {
        const user = await User.findOne({ username: "sherbiny" });
        if (user) {
            console.log(user.age); // Output => 20
            user.age = 25;
            await user.save();
            console.log(user.age); // Output => 25
        } else {
            console.log('User not found');
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating user:', error);
    }
};
```

Alternative solution using `then()`:
```js
const updateAge = () => {
    User.findOne({ username: "sherbiny" })
        .then(user => {
            if (user) {
                console.log(user.age); // Output => 20
                user.age = 25;
                return user.save();
            } else {
                console.log('User not found');
            }
        })
        .then(updatedUser => {
            if (updatedUser) {
                console.log(updatedUser.age); // Output => 25
            }
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error updating user:', error);
        });
};
```
