##  Q2: What is the Mongoose model, How to create one and, What are its uses?

**A Mongoose model** is a constructor that provides an interface for interacting with a MongoDB collection. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete documents in the MongoDB database. A model in Mongoose is created from a schema, which defines the structure and rules for the documents in the collection.

### How to Create a Mongoose Model?
To create a Mongoose model, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define a Schema: The schema defines the structure of the documents in the collection, including field names, types, validation rules, and more.
2. Create the Model: Once the schema is defined, you can create a model using Mongooseâ€™s model() method. This model acts as the interface to the MongoDB collection.

### Example

1. **Define a Schema**: You define the schema by specifying the fields and their data types, as well as any validation rules or default values.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define a schema for a Task
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true  // Name is required
  },
  completed: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false  // Default value for 'completed' is false
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now  // Automatically set creation date
  }
});
```

2. **Create the Model**: Now, you can create a model from the schema using the mongoose.model() method. The model represents the collection, and it allows you to perform operations on that collection.

```js
const Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema);
```

In this example:

- The model Task corresponds to the MongoDB collection named tasks (Mongoose automatically pluralizes the model name).
- The schema defines the structure of each task document.

### Uses of a Mongoose Model

A Mongoose model is used to interact with a specific MongoDB collection, and it provides various methods to create, read, update, and delete documents (CRUD operations).

 **1. Create Documents:** You can create a new document in the MongoDB collection using the save() method or create() method.

```js
const newTask = new Task({ name: 'Buy groceries' });
newTask.save()
  .then(() => console.log('Task saved'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**2.Read Documents:** You can retrieve documents from the collection using methods like find(), findOne(), or findById().

```js
   await Task.find();
  .then(tasks => console.log(tasks))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**3.Update Documents:** You can update documents using methods like findByIdAndUpdate(), updateOne(), or updateMany().

```js
Task.findByIdAndUpdate('60d9c00b8cfa3e6f8c4f8e55', { completed: true })
  .then(() => console.log('Task updated'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**4.Delete Documents:** You can remove documents from the collection using methods like findByIdAndDelete(), deleteOne(), or deleteMany().

```js
Task.findByIdAndRemove('60d9c00b8cfa3e6f8c4f8e55')
  .then(() => console.log('Task deleted'))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
