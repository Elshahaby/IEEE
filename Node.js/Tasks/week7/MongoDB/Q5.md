## Q5: How would you add validation to a Mongoose schema to ensure a string property is at least 3 characters long?

you can use the `minlength` validator on the schema field. This built-in validator ensures that the string meets the minimum length requirement.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true,  // This field is required
    minlength: 3     // Username must be at least 3 characters long
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

```
