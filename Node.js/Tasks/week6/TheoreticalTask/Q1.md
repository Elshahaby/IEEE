## Q1:According to your understanding; explain what's the difference between fs.readFile and fs.readFileSync methods.

Key differences:
 
- Blocking (Sync) vs Non-Blocking (ASync)
    - `fs.readFileSync` blocks execution until the file is read, while `fs.readFile` allows other operations to continue and calls a callback function once done.

- Use case:
    - `fs.readFileSync` is useful for small scripts or when you want to ensure that no further code runs until the file is availabale.
    - `fs.readFile` is more appropriate for servers or applications where performance and responsiveness matter, as it doesn't block other operation.
