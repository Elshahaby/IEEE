## Q4: Break through this `package.json` file and explain its contents.
    
```json
{
    "name": "url-shortener-app",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node ./bin/www",
        "start:dev": "nodemon ./bin/www"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
        "debug": "~2.6.9",
        "dotenv": "^16.4.4",
        "ejs": "^3.1.9",
        "express": "^4.18.2",
        "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
        "mongodb": "^6.3.0",
        "mongoose": "^8.1.3",
        "morgan": "~1.9.1",
        "shortid": "^2.2.16",
        "valid-url": "^1.0.9"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "nodemon": "^3.0.1"
    }
}
```

1. `name` : store the name of the project.
2. `version` : store version of the project.It's set to "0.0.0", indicating that the project may be in its early stages of development. Versions typically follow the semantic versioning format (major.minor.patch).
3. `private`: is set true, it means that this project/package cannot be accidentally published to the npm registry. it is a good practice for internal applications that are not meant to be shared publicly.
4. `scripts`: define commands for starting the app (start) and for running it in development (start:dev).
5. `dependencies`: lists the external packages required by the project.These packages are installed when `npm install` is run.Every package is specified with a version.
6. `devDependencies` are tools used only during development.

- By managing dependencies through `package.json`, developers can easily replicate the environment using `npm install`, ensuring consistency across different setups (linux,windows,Mac).
