## Q2: Explain with examples the difference between installing a package as a normal dependency vs. as a development dependency with npm.

### 1. Noraml Dependency.

- Uses: These are the packages that your application needs during runtime. If the package is essential for your application when it at deployment phase or run in production, it should be installed as a noraml dependency.

    - command to install it

    ```
        npm i <package-name> --save
    ```
    or
    ```
        npm i <package-name>
    ```
    (in newer versions of npm, `--save` is set by default)
    - This adds the package to the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

### 2. Development Dependency.

- Uses: Use Case: These are the packages that are only required during development, such as testing libraries. They are not needed when the application is running in production but are useful for developers.

    - command to install it
    ```
        npm i --save-dev <package-name>
        or
        npm i -D <package-name>
    ```
    - This adds the package to the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json` file.
