## Q3: What is the purpose of the `node_modules` folder, and why should it typically be excluded from version control systems like Git?

#### What is the purpose of the `node_modules` folder?

- The `node_modules` folder is where npm stores all the installed packages (dependencies) for my project. When you run the command `npm install <package-name>`,npm downloads the package from the npm registry and places the inside this folder.
- It contains the actual code and files for the libraries your project depends on, as well as their nested dependencies of these libraries.
- This folder can contain hunderds of files, ecpecially for projects with many dependencies and sub-dependencies.

#### Why `node_modules` should be Excluded form version control like Git?

- because it has large size and redundant files.
- Dependency management can be handled via `package.json`.
- The contents of `node_modules` can differ depending on the operating system or environment (Windows, macOS, Linux). By excluding it from version control, you avoid potential conflicts or platform-specific issues.
- All the dependencies your project needs are already defined in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. These files precisely specify which packages are required to build or run the project.
- Any developer can simply run `npm install`, and npm will use the lock file to install the exact same dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.
