## Q1 : Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code.

#### Synchronous :-

- Synchronous code runs in a single thread and executes one statement at a time in the order they appear in the code. The program waits for each statement to finish executing before moving on to the next one. This means that if a function call takes a long time to complete, it will block the entire program until itâ€™s done. This can cause performance problems if there are many long-running synchronous operations, as the program will appear unresponsive to the user.

#### Asynchronous :-

- Asynchronous code allows multiple operations to be executed concurrently without blocking the program. This is done by using callbacks or promises to signal when an operation has completed, allowing the program to continue executing other statements while the operation is being performed
