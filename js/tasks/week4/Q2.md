## Q2: Explain the difference between this keyword's value in the following examples:-

### answer : => this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. The value of this can vary depending on how a function is called.

  ---

### 1- Arrow function in Object Literal

```js 

const player1 = {
  firstName: "Ahmed",
  lastName: "Hafez",
  introduce: () => {
    console.log(this); // Window Object
    console.log(`Hey, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
  }
}

console.log(player1.introduce()); // Hey, I'm undefined undefined

```

#### answer:- 
- #### arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope (Window Object) at the time they are defined. This is useful for methods like event handlers, where you want this to refer to the surrounding scope rather than the event

### 2- Regular Function in Object Literal

```js

const player2 = {
  firstName: "Ahmed",
  lastName: "Hafez",
  introduce() {
    console.log(this); // this refers to player2 Object
    console.log(`Hey, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
  }
}

console.log(player2.introduce()); //  Hey, I'm Ahmed Hafez

```

#### answer:-
- ####  using a regular function with the object literal binds this to the object player2, so this.firstName and this.lastName refer to the properties of player2 Object.

### 3- Function Defined Outside Object Literal

```js

function introduce() {
  console.log(this);// this refers to player3
  console.log(`Hey, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
}
const player3 = {
  firstName: "Ahmed",
  lastName: "Hafez",
  //  : دي ميزة في جافا سكربت ان لو الكي هو نفسه الفاليو مش لازم تحط  
  introduce
}

console.log(player3.introduce()); // Hey, I'm Ahmed Hafez
// player3.introduce.bind(player3)();  

```
#### answer:- 
#### same as the pervious , the difference is that the fucntion declered globally then assigned to the player3 , so when you invoke Player3.introduce() the context of this is the player3 Object.

<br>

### 4- Function Called Directly and Using call()

```js

function introduce() {
  console.log(this);
  console.log(`Hey, I'm ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
}
const player4 = {
  firstName: "Ahmed",
  lastName: "Hafez"
}

introduce();  // Hey, I'm undefined undefined
introduce.call(player4); // Hey, I'm Ahmed Hafez    

```

#### answer:-
#### When introduce is called directly, this will refer to the global object. However, when call is used to explicitly set this to player4, this.firstName and this.lastName correctly refer to the properties of player4.
